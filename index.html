		<p class ='content'> VRF is its full form is about Labeling (via MPLS) your traffic at layer 3 ( similar concept to Vlans at layer 2).  <br>In VRF , traffic is isolated from source to destination through the MPLS cloud which uses MPBGP in the serv-<br>ice provider  Cloud environment.RD and RTs (Route Distinguishers and Route Targets) are incorporated for ov-<br>erlapping Route segregation and using Common services.</p>

		<p class ='content'>VRF-lite is a feature that enables a service provider to support two or more VPNs, where IP addresses can be <br> overlapped among the VPNs. VRF-lite uses input interfaces to distinguish routes for different VPNs and for-<br>ms virtual packet-forwarding tables by associating one or more Layer 3 interfaces with each VRF. Interfaces<br>in a VRF can be either physical, such as Ethernet ports, or logical, such as VLAN SVIs, but a Layer 3 inter-<br>face cannot belong to more than one VRF at any time.</p>
